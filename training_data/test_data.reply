Who salutes who? An officer has to salute everyone he comes across. General officer? Gotta salute him. Lowest PVT? Gotta return that salute.

Right, yeah! I totally forgot most of the floor show, somehow. I think that''s about the point in the movie where I just give up on understanding what I''m watching, so I forgot about it.

True, but you have to take into consideration that this is his first season in a completely different league. It takes time to get used to it, and it happens to many players who switch leagues. Maybe next season he will return to his world class form. newline  newline

Yeah I had a CP earlier this year. I told my dad, and mentioned that I didn''t want anyone to know.  Next time I call I can hear people speaking in the background and he starts loudly asking me all about it.  Ughh. 
I just love that whole episode. So glad that the writers/ producers let Richard Speight know that his character is alive- it gives me hope we''ll be seeing more of him! 
No man, look closer, there''s a camera lens that you can see through the weaving of the basket. 
Any cliche has some value
True, but its a touchy subject especially so for a lot of people. I love these edits though. The best one was the Bill Murray version of this.

Not just ''forget them''... some are arguing that they should all be fired.  In truth, this is just more of the tedious liberal hypocrisy.
That would make sense. For compatibility/validation reasons we use older versions of IE while FF or Chrome would be current.

Yes, I''m aware. He specifically said that Intel should make CPUs that are actually designed without the iGPU and that use the extra silicon for more cache or CPU cores. That is exactly that they do with Haswell-E and its predecessors.
