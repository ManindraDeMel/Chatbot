I''ve thought about it, and did check it out, but I''m not enough of a techie to be a mod, it would be a very boring sub, looking all bland and with *just me* writing this story, posts would come infrequently, it doesn''t seem worthwhile.
This is on the Mildly Infuriating subreddit, dude. OP is just doing a slight vent. Why the hell are you here if you''re going to bitch about people''s posts?

That was a much simpler time and honestly, Elementz was a fine support (aside from breaking under the pressure and missing important ults)
Cool, reply once the clock strikes 12am, fan.
Based on this season alone, there is no way you can say that Falcao is world class, and compare him to Aguero and Messi. I think they should keep him, but hes no where near those other guys, at least not now.
Wait... obito was there? ?
Those socks are gold. I own about 10 pairs and they took a pair back that had holes in them, they were smelly and dirty as shit. No questions asked.

Ahh, but which ''Kvothe''s story'' is coming to an end? Just the story he is telling, or the rest of his life story. I guess I''m hoping for the latter since I''d like to see him going out to correct the wrongs he has apparently brought into the world...
The estimates I''ve heard tossed around are that Cap is peak Olympic athlete strength, Spidey is about ten times that, and big guns like Thor are about ten times that again....

My hometown has a Family Video that is *thriving*. There are always people in there, and they''ve been open since forever. My theory is that they survive because we are in a small town where not everyone has internet, and they also offer video game and porn.

I don''t think it mattered who TCU played today. They were thirsting for blood and only a top four team (if that) would have stopped them. 
What do you think of note 4?
The actor who plays the governor is so talented, that''s how I endure the scenes with Andrea.  The woman who plays Andrea is such a horrible actor...I just can''t stand it.  They should have switched the actors and kept the girl who played Amy. 
And she would know how to get the passcode off an Apple product when you don''t know/don''t remember it. They have step by step instructions on their website.
